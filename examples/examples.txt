line_ratio

Computes the ratio of two spectra at different temperatures.
Assumes med-res spectra extracted to working or child directory.
If run standalone, plots ratio vs. wavelength and exits.

EXAMPLE: plot ratio of 5800 K and 3800 K spectra (default values), smoothed to 1 nm resolution

$ python3 line_ratio.py

spectral_temporal_model

This package is used to plot the relative flux of a spotted star,
resolved both spectrally (y-axis) and temporally (x-axis).

Before execution, define the spot parameters in settings file
"spectral_temporal_model_settings.py".

When executed, a model is created with the specified spots.
LDTK is used to calculate the nonlinear LD coefficients, for
both the star and the spot, as a function of wavelength.
The appropriate PHOENIX spectra are used to calculate the
wavelength-dependent contrast ratio of the starspots.
The lightcurve for each wavelength bin is then calculated
using MACULA, with the corresponding LD coefficients and
contrast ratio.

The relative flux is then plotted as a 2D heatmap.

EXAMPLE: create plots for the specified spot configuration

$ python3 spectral_temporal_model.py


spot_TDV_model

This module is used to create a large number of starspot models
with a range of parameters, optionally constrained to a specified
level of brightness variation. The models are saved to disk, and
two plots are produced for each: a 3-panel plot, with the mean
lightcurve and several TDV curves adjacent to the full 2-D flux;
and a 2-panel plot, with the mean lightcurve and the full
distribution of TDV curves.

Before executing, define settings in "spot_TDV_model_settings.py".

EXAMPLE: create a random set of starspot models and plots

$ python3 spot_TDV_model.py

comparison_plot

This script generates a plot comparing the transit depth variations
(TDV) caused by starspots to those caused by a transiting planet's
atmosphere. First, compute flux models with spot_TDV_model and use
the generated plots to select a model (the number in the plot's
filename). Locate the .pkl file with that number; this is your
flux_file. Next, use Exo-Transmit to compute spectra for your
planet's atmosphere; edit the appropriate lines below to identify
your spectra files. To change the compositions listed below, use
search-and-replace. Finally, set the remaining variables and
execute the script.
